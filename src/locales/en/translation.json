        "q1": "How does AmanVision detect a fall?",
        "a1": "Our AI analyzes video streams in real-time to identify key points of the human body (digital skeleton). It instantly recognizes characteristic posture changes of a fall, even in complex environments.",
        "q2": "What type of cameras need to be installed?",
        "a2": "The system is agnostic: it works with most existing CCTV cameras (IP, converted analog). No installation of wearable sensors on people is necessary.",
        "q3": "Does the system record faces or identity?",
        "a3": "No. To guarantee privacy (GDPR), we only process shapes and movements (poses). No permanent recording is made and no facial recognition is used.",
        "q4": "Does the system work in the dark?",
        "a4": "Yes, provided your cameras have infrared night vision. The AI is trained to interpret black and white streams from IR sensors.",
        "q5": "What is the real delay of an alert?",
        "a5": "Detection takes place in less than 0.8 seconds. The alert is transmitted instantly via our Cloud platform to your mobiles or security PCs.",
        "q6": "Is it suitable for construction sites or industrial environments?",
        "a6": "Absolutely. AmanVision ignores machinery and tool movements to focus solely on human postures and distress situations (lone worker, malaise).",
        "q7": "What happens in case of power or internet outage?",
        "a7": "We offer local Edge-AI gateways that continue analysis even without internet. For power, the use of a standard UPS protects the detection hardware.",
        "q8": "Can I install it at my home for a loved one?",
        "a8": "Yes, our 'Aman Personal' offer is specifically designed for seniors living alone. It allows benevolent monitoring without intrusion into privacy.",
        "q9": "Can the system distinguish an animal from a person?",
        "a9": "Yes. The algorithm is trained to filter pets (dogs, cats) and only triggers on the human biomechanical structure.",
        "q10": "What are the legal obligations for installation?",
        "a10": "For companies, it is enough to inform employees and update the GDPR register. We provide all template documents and necessary signage for mandatory display."
